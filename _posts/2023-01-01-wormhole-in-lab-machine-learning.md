Wormhole created in the lab! A tunnel of connections between two points in space and time - a tunnel from one time and place to another. Does it mean we can now do the **Time Travel**? Is **Wormhole** and **Black Hole** the same thing?

Yes, but completely not. Wormhole has been created at Quantum level, where two points are just fermimeters away, to record a significant time jump, they must be light years apart, but you can say at that microscopic level, it actually happened with small amount of seconds.

Wormholes and Black holes are almost same but with different physical ending. Wormholes having a bridge between them, and Black holes till date we know that they end at singularity (no existence point), but if that bridge between wormholes is not stable, then you end up like in Black Hole.

# History: Are we a part of Hologram?
It all started in 1935, when two papers ER (Einstein - Rosen) and EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) which talks about [Einstein-Rosen Bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole) (Wormhole) and [Quantum Entaglement](https://www.space.com/31933-quantum-entanglement-action-at-a-distance.html) respectively. They both talks about transferring information between two points but at very different scales.

When Jacob Benkenstein and Stephen Hawking tried to compute about the information content present in the Black hole, he got suprised to know that the content depends upon area of event horizon of black hole not its volume, this hinted a relationship between quantum information and spatial world of our daily experience.

![Holographic Principle](/assets/images/holographic-principle.png)

In the 1990s, a physicist named as Mart√≠n Maldacena, has proved using mathematical equation an existence of Anti-de Sitter Space (AdS), alternative to our current space (de Sitter Space), in which you move out of the centre, you shrink due to negative energy, unlike in de Sitter Space where it is moved outwards by positive energy. This means that 3D Objects in AdS (Anti-de Sitter Space), shrink down to 2d or Quantum Information. This principle known as [Holographic Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle). **Maybe we are in a hologram**

This principle lead us to a very important equation that **ER = EPR**, means that Wormholes are the projection of the process of Quantum Entanglement, this unifies General Theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, resulting in a new field i.e. **Quantum Gravity**

# Experiment: Wormhole in the lab
The experiment used the holographic principle to translate quantum information into spacetime physics, allowing a particle to fall into one side of a wormhole and witness it emerge on the other side, and to implement this idea, researchers taked help from Sycamore, Google Quantum Computer. 

As we have discussed earlier, that wormholes are not traversable as they are unstable, but it has been shownn that if we provide a [shockwave](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0550321385905255) of negative energy to the bridge - a deformation of spacetime that propagates at the speed of light, propping open the wormhole long enough to allow traversability. So in Quantum computer and dual space-time picture, rotating all of the particles' spin directions results in a negative-energy shock wave that sweeps through the wormhole, kicking the qubit forward and, at a predicted time, out of the mouth.

The so-called SYK model is a system of matter particles that interact in groups rather than pairs. Subir Sachdev and Jinwu Ye first defined it in 1993, and it was proven to be holographic in 2015 by theoretical physicist Alexei Kitaev. Kitaev showed that the particular version of the model in which matter particles interact in groups of four is mathematically mappable to a **one-dimensional black hole in AdS space**, with identical symmetries and other properties, at a lecture that year in Santa Barbara, California.

Maldacena and colleagues argued that linking two SYK models might encode the two mouths of traversable wormhole. Jafferis and Gao took the approach. They had developed a [concrete prescription](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07416) for teleporting a qubit of information from one system of four-way-interacting particles to another by 2019.

A whole SYK model is made up of almost an endless number of particles that are randomly connected to one another with random intensities as four-way interactions occur throughout. This is not calculable; even if all 50-odd available qubits were used, it would have needed hundreds of thousands of circuit operations. The scientists set out to build a holographic wormhole using only seven qubits and hundreds of operations. To accomplish this, they had to "sparsify" the seven-particle SYK model by recording only the strongest four-way interactions and omitting the rest, while keeping the model's holographic features.

Here comes are saviour Machine Learning

![ml-wormhole-optimization](/assets/images/ml-wormhole-google.png)

They began with a big quantum system and handled it like a neural network. Backpropagation updated the system's parameters in order to retain gravitational qualities, while sparsification lowered the system's size. They used machine learning to train a system that retained only one important gravitational signature: the importance of deploying a negative energy shockwave. The procedure reduced the number of four-way interactions from hundreds down to five.

This is holographically dual to the qubit entering the left mouth of a one-dimensional wormhole in AdS space.

Then there's the enormous rotation of all the qubits, which is synchronised with a pulse of negative energy running down the wormhole. The injected qubit is transferred to the particles of the right-hand SYK model as a result of the rotation. The states of all the qubits are then measured. Counting 0s and 1s over a large number of experimental runs and comparing these statistics to the prepared state of the injected qubits shows whether or not qubits are teleporting over.

![peak-over-wormhole-information](/assets/images/peak-wormhole.png)
The researchers are looking for a data peak that shows a difference between two cases: If they detect the peak, it indicates that qubit rotations that are dual to negative-energy pulses allow qubits to teleport, whereas rotations in the opposite way do not and after two years of steady progress and noise-reduction efforts, the peak came on the screen late one night in January.

Have a look at a detailed documentry of this event in above video, how the idea started from scratch with great illustrations.
